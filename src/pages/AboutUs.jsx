    <p>Straight out of the fire is a record label and clothing bread.At our core, we are a team of resilient and determined individuals who have risen from humble beginnings to achieve our wildest dreams. We know what it's like to come from nothing and have to work hard to build a better life for ourselves and our loved ones.

Our shared experiences have instilled in us a deep appreciation for the value of hard work, persistence, and perseverance. We believe that with enough determination, anything is possible, and we strive to inspire others to pursue their own dreams and ambitions, no matter how daunting they may seem.

Our mission is to empower those who come from similar backgrounds, to give them the tools and resources they need to succeed. We know what it takes to overcome obstacles and break through barriers, and we are committed to sharing our knowledge and expertise to help others do the same.

Through our work, we hope to create a world where anyone, regardless of their upbringing or circumstances, can achieve their goals and build a life they are proud of. We believe that with hard work, passion, and a little bit of luck, anything is possible.</p>
